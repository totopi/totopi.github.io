                    <p>Leader of project with three other members of UCI's Data Analytics / Visualisation Bootcamp.  Using datasets gathered from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a>, we created an application that will show you three different views on weather and flight delays for major travel destinations within the United States.  I was in charge of the backend and making sure everybody's code worked smoothly with everything, as well as maintaining our <a href="https://github.com/totopi/Travel-Informers">Github Repo</a>.</p>

                    <p>Sole developer on a page that takes in USGS earthquake data over a recent period and maps it with timeline controls.  I was also curious to look at the earthquakes that happened around March 11th, 2011 in Japan, because that was an insane time and place to be alive.</p>

                    <a href="https://github.com/totopi/Retro-Fireballs">Retro Fireballs: Game of Thrones Sentiment Analysis</a><br />
                    <p>Team lead for a group project during UCI's Data Analytics / Visualisation Bootcamp.  We examined the sentiments of the script of each episode of Game of Thrones using VADER sentiment analysis and looked for outside corrolation mostly unsuccessfully.  A great learning experience for me as a leader on a programming team.  Also great learning experience for limitations of free public APIs.</p>
